## What I learned

This assignment was challenging to say the least. I was  unable to correctly figure out how to add a timer and score. Although this was challenging it was satisfying to be able to complete a quiz. I was able to learn how to style the container with with padding, margin space, and font styles. Also, learning a new design skills on how to change the background for correct answers and wrong answers. Coming from zero experience slowing but surely I feel that I am able to use my google fu to put together a decent webpage. 


Your Task

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
